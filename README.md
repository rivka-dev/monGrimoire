# Develop the back-end of a book rating site
Mon Vieux Grimoire - Creation From Scratch of the back-end of a site

## Script
You have been a freelance back-end developer for a year now in the Lille region. You are used to working with Kevin, a more experienced front-end developer than you, who already has a good network of contacts in the industry.

KÃ©vin contacts you to offer you to work with him by pooling your two-sided skills on a brand new project that has been proposed to him. This is a small chain of bookstores that wants to open a book referencing and rating site.
### Missions
From: Kevin
To me
Subject: RE RE Development of a book rating site

Hi,

That's it, I finished the front-end of the site! Everything is available on GitHub. I also prepared the technical specifications document of the API, which will in fact be your specifications for the development of the back-end. Make sure that the whole site works well, normally the front is completely ready to connect to your API.

Once you've finished, I suggest that we both make a point so that you present your code to me, and that we make the application work well. Then, I can send all this to the client, and present the finalized site to him.

#### Last request
For the project to comply with the good practices of the Green Code, the size of the images must be taken into account.
In the Back-End, the images that will be sent by users must be optimized. There will be many.
